This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It uses Express JS as the backend to serve the requests from the React frontend client

The use-case:
As a small business owner, I want to process a one-time card payment from a US customer for the purchase of an item that costs $10.99; 

## To run the program ## 

npm install cors
npm run backend 
npm start
